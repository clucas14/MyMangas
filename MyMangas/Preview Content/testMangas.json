But since then, things have changed. With demons now being praised and worshipped by society, the samurai are shunned and disgraced. \n\nAfraid of revealing his dream of becoming a samurai, Musashi blends into the town's dogma by becoming a miner while secretly polishing his swordsmanship. Meanwhile, despite being a direct descendant of a samurai, Kojirou gives up on his promise to his old friend. However, after saving Musashi from a near-death experience, his perspective shifts. Although still conflicted, Kojirou embarks on a journey with Musashi in the hopes of figuring out his true feelings.\n\nFighting against all odds, the duo dives headfirst into the unknown world of beast-slaying, not knowing what life has in store for them. Now astride iron horses, the 15-year-old heroes plan to restore the tarnished reputation of the samurai and purge the world of demons.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The Vatican has refused to acknowledge the situation, treating each incident as nothing more than simple coincidence, but in the years that have passed since the Holy War ended, the Pope has been rumored to have created an occult organization called RADEM, whose orders are to fight demons though they seem to have another mission - a much more obscure mission...\n\nThe Cardinal calls for an assembly of the region’s clergymen in the name of the Pope to discuss the situation, and to that end, an ambitious nun named Sister Rose is sent to the Teatela Province on a mission to locate Father Gabriel Iota - a priest suspected of possessing a very strong Holy Power...\n\n(Source: Cireus-Scanlations)",
